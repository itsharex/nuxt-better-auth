description: Current status of Convex integration in this module.
---

This module does not currently provide a built-in Convex adapter integration.

## Status

- Convex-specific module configuration (`auth.database.provider = 'convex'`) is not supported.
- The maintained paths in this module are NuxtHub-backed storage and database-less/client-only usage.

## Recommended paths

- For external Better Auth backends, use [External Auth Backend](/guides/external-auth-backend).
- For Convex-specific auth/database setup, use the upstream Convex and Better Auth documentation.
